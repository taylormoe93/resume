# resume
Final resume project for application to Prime Academy.
This is just my most recent work history and some highlights of the last few years of work. My complete resume is available, upon request.

# Learning Resources used:
    * Prime Academy workshops
    * Stack Overflow and Google to troubleshoot errors that I encountered.
    * This Microsoft workshop: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/educator-developer-blog/create-a-resume-website-no-coding-experience-required/ba-p/3056672 
    * W3 Schools and Stack Overflow for implementing images and Javascript.
    * Mozilla Developer Resources, "Javascript Basics": https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics#a_hello_world!_example

# Tools used:
    * Github.dev was my main environment. 
    * JSBin for testing and troubleshooting some things in isolation.
    * Codeswing extension for Github.dev to see the page being developed in real-time.

# Thoughts upon completion:
    * I pieced together several tutorials and instructions to make the finished project. I sought out tutorials that actively described why they were doing what they were doing. I'm still at the learning stage where I'm not likely to remember the code I'm writing right off the bat, so I felt it was more important to just get exposed to the reasoning and design, more so than to remember the code itself. 
 
    * That being said, I did end up remembering and retaining an understanding of more of the code than I thought I would. I might not be able to write this whole resume project again from scratch, but I do feel as if I could look at the code and describe what a good portion it is and what it's affecting.

    * All in all, I feel as if I understand far more than I did before this project. I have a better lay of the land in terms of resources I can reliably pull from online, such as Stack Overflow and the Mozilla Developer Resources. And I feel less apprehensive about trying things out, letting it break the project, and then troubleshooting my way out of the problem. 

     * Thank you for looking at my project!
